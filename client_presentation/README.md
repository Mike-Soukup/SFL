# Overview:

The Client Presentation Deck PDF document is a slide deck prepared to review the client concerns with them in a meeting or teleconference setting. The intent of these slides is to present them to the client and to provide on the spot feedback to any additional questions and concerns.


The Client Presentation Supplement serves as an additional document to provide to clients to supplement the slides. This can be provided to learners who prefer to read, couldn't make the meeting, or perhaps wanted a refresher of the material without having to hop on another call.
