# Overview:

This repository represents the work I conducted on the SFL Scientific Take Home Assessment from 2023-08-11 through 2023-08-13.

## Part 1 - Consulting Soft Skills:

My submission for this part can be found in this repository within the `client_presentation` directory. This directory contains an example client slide deck and supplementary document that I would share with a client to go over the specific questions and concerns outlined in the assessment. 

## Part 2 - Database & Python ETL:

My submission for this part can be found within the `db_python_etl` directory. 

## Part 3 - ML API:

My submission for this part can be found in a separate GitHub Repository found at https://github.com/Mike-Soukup/SFL_MLAPI 

Putting the code in this separate repository helps to ensure git is utilized effectively and commits to changes on the other two compoenents of the take home assessment do not interefer with the CI/CD pipeline and deployment of the API I developed.
